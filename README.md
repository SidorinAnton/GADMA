Welcome to GADMA!

GADMA implements methods for automatic inferring joint demographic history of multiple populations from the genetic data.

GADMA is based on two open source packages: the ∂a∂i developed by Ryan Gutenkunst [<https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi/>] and the *moments* developed by Simon Gravel [<https://bitbucket.org/simongravel/moments/>].

In contrast, GADMA is a command-line tool. It presents a series of launches of the genetic algorithm and infer demographic history from Allele Frequency Spectrum of multiple populations (up to three).

GADMA is implemented by Ekaterina Noskova (ekaterina.e.noskova@gmail.com)
