#	It is extra parameters file for GADMA software.

#	Lines started from # are ignored.
#	Also comments at the end of a line are ignored too.
#	Every line contains: Identificator of parameter : value.
#	If you want to change some default parameters, you need to 
#	remove # at the begining of line and change corresponding 
#	parameter.


#	Lower and upper bounds on N - sizes of populations, 
#	T - time of time periods, M - migration rates.
#	All bounds are relative to N_A: N is in N_A units, 
#	T in 2 * N_A units and M in 1 / (2 * N_A).
#	Default:	min_N = 0.01, max_N = 100.0, min_T = 0.0, 
#				max_T = 5.0, min_M = 0.0, max_M = 10.0

#	Parameter for sfs plots. vmin - minimum value plotted for sfs.
#	Default: 1 or 0 if all values of fs are <= 1.0
Vmin : {20}



#	Parameters for local search algorithms (exclude hill climbing)

#	If > 0, print optimization status every <verbose> steps.
#	Default: None = number of parameters. (i. e. len(p0))
Verbose : {6}

#	Standard output will be flushed once every <flush_delay>
#	minutes. This is useful to avoid overloading I/O on clusters.
#	Default: 0.5
Flush delay : {7}

#	Step-size to use for finite-difference derivatives.
#	Ignored if local search is optimize_log_fmin.
#	Default: 0.001
Epsilon for ls : {8}

#	Convergence criterion for optimization. For more info, 
#	see help(scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs)
#	(pgtol for optimize_lbfgsb and optimize_log_lbfgsb)
#	Ignored if local search is optimize_log_fmin.
#	Default : 1e-05
Gtol : {9}

#	Maximum iterations to run for.
#	Default : 100
Maxiter : {10}


#	Special for hill climbing optimization

#	Mean mutation rate.
#	Default: None (equal for GA mutation_rate)
Mean mutation rate for hc : {11}

#	Const for adaptive mutation rate
#	Default: None (equal to GA const for mutation rate)
Const for mutation rate for hc : {12}

#	Number of iterations without improvement to stop.
#	Epsilon is equal to GA epsilon.
#	Default: None (equal to GA stop iteration)
Stop iteration for hc : {13}



#	Options of mutation, crossing and random generating.
#	Multinomial option make ga convergence faster, but
#	it can find worse solutions than without multinomial.

#	Mutation can be multinomial: we change paraneters and then
#	scale all(!) parameters with optimal_sfs_scaling.
#	Default: False
Multinomial mutation : {14}

#	Crossing can be multinomial too: we scale parameters of eash
#	model to get N_A = 1, then cross such models and scale back
#	with optimal_sfs_scaling.
#	Default: False
Multinomial crossing : {15}

#	To get random model we sample number between bounds (min_N, 
#	max_N, min_T, etc.) and then scale them with 
#	optimal_sfs_scaling. We can choose N_A random between min_N 
#	and max_N or we can always take it as 1.0.
#	Default: True
Random N_A : {16}



#	Options of printing summary information about repeats 
#	in parent process.
#	How often print all best by likelihood and by BIC models.
#	Default: 1 (minute)
Time to print summary : {17}



#	Options of distributions
#	Note that normal is actually truncated normal.

#	Distribution for generating mutation rate.
#	Mean mutation rate is parameter. So we can shoose here
#	Distribution and std (in case of normal distribution).
#	Default: 'normal', None (std = mean)

Std : {19}
